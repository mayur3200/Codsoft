Subject:Calculator, guessing number game, and tic tac toe game (Codsoft internship)

This commit adds three new C++ programs to the repository:

* calculator.py: A simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations.
* guessing_number.py: A guessing number game where the user tries to guess a random number generated by the computer.
* tic_tac_toe.py: A tic tac toe game that can be played by two players.

These programs were developed as part of the Codsoft internship application process.
